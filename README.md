- The AI agent autonomously navigates the environment using pathfinding algorithms to move efficiently across the navigation mesh (displayed in green).
- The navigation mesh is composed of triangular walkable areas, allowing the AI to traverse the environment while avoiding obstacles.
- The blue line represents the path computed using the Funnel Algorithm, which ensures natural and smooth movement across the terrain.
- The yellow triangles indicate the neighboring triangles of the triangle where the AI is currently positioned. These neighboring connections are crucial for    
  pathfinding and traversal decisions.
- The white sphere is the AIâ€™s target position. The AI continuously updates its path to reach this target while navigating around obstacles.
- The obstacles (gray rocky blocks) represent non-walkable areas where triangles are filtered out to prevent AI from attempting movement through solid objects.
